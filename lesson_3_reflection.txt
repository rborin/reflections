When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So you can share your work with others or yourself in other computers. Also
    to serve as an online backup of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Many people might be working and pushing changes to the repository that
    may not be important or relevant to you when you are working on something
    else (like some new feature). So these changes can wait until you decide
    to pull them into your repository and possibly merge with your branches.
